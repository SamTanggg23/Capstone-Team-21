# DS-GA-1006-Capstone
Recommendation system design

## Brief Introduction

This repository contains most of our important codes for our Capstone Project. 

Specifically, the folder 'prompt_engineering' includes how we use OpenAI's API to automatically label the unlabeled data based on the prompt. It is an efficient pipeline. Hope that'll be useful to you!

Meanwhile, data couldn't be shared so the folder 'data' is empty. Hope you understand that!
